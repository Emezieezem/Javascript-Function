#Javascript Function
The function "checkClassAccess" accepts two parameters: hasSubmittedAssignment and  attendedPreviousClass.
   - It checks if both conditions are true using an if statement:
     - If both conditions are true, it grants access (prints "Access granted to the class. You can attend.").
     - If either condition is false, it denies access (prints "Access denied, submit your assignment and reach out to your class captain.").

2. Variables:
   - hasSubmittedAssignment: This variable holds a boolean value (either true or false) to represent whether the student has submitted the assignment.
   -  attendedPreviousClass: This variable holds a boolean value to represent whether the student has took previous attendance.

This approach gives you a simple way to check multiple conditions (like assignment submission and attendance) and grant or deny access based on those conditions.
